    What is git & github?
      Git: is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code, and it is free and open source
      GitHub is a web-based platform that allows you to host and share your code with others.
        (other platforms Similar to github: [gitLab,bitBucket]).
      github simplify using git.
      Note: you can use git without github.
      git has GUI.(it is prefered to use git in command line to develope yourself).

    why you must learn git?
      1. developers contribute to the same project.(no one has his own project).
      2. you can revert changes.
      3. you can see who made the changes.
      4. you can collaborate to fix issues.
      5. you can collaborate to create new features.
      6. you can solve conflicts.
      7. you can organize features.

    Words you will hear:
      - repository(repo): which is put the projects in it (each project must has it own repo).
      - branch: is a copy of the repo for updating the project then return it to the repo.
      - local repo: is the repo on your Device as PC.
      - remote repo: is the repo on the server or the github...etc.
      - commit: is a snapshot or checkPoint in your local repo that has not sent yet to the remote repo.
      - clone: add a copy from local or remote.(you can add copies from local to other location to compare or try somthing
        for example which better website: PHP pure or frameWork).
      - push: is sending the commit to the remote repo.
      - pull: is getting the commit from the remote repo to the local repo.
      - Pull Request: is a request to merge the branch to the main branch by telling other about changes.

    Important Note:
      - Create repository for every Project.
      - Create anew branch for every feature or enhancement.
      - no needd to connect to remote repo when working.
      - anyone can push and pull depend on permissions.


    create repo and clone it:
      1. sign up in github website.
      2. create a new repo by writing a repo name, describtion, you want it private or public, add README file, and click create repository.
        Note: README.md (md is a stand for markdown [search about it in wikipedia]).
        Note: to add heading in README file, you should put # before the script.
        3. clone the changes by copy the link of the repo from the github then go to the CMD and put it in a specific place in your device
          by writing the code (git clone TheLink).(Note: when you enter in it, you will see the README file and next to the directory(main -> master)).

    add & reset & commit:
    some git command in cmd.
      git status: to know the status or what is missed or what is happening in the directory.
      git add fileName(in his full directory): to add the untracked files in the project.
        Note: you can add all the files by using * instead of directory.
      git reset head fileName: to reset the changes in the project. for example, you don't want a specific file.
